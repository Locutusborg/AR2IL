## Introduction to Git & Github

Git is a powerful version control system that allows multiple developers to work on the same codebase without conflicts, tracking changes and enabling seamless integration of contributions. GitHub, a cloud-based platform built around Git, enhances this experience by providing a collaborative space where developers can host repositories, review code, and manage projects. With features like pull requests, issue tracking, and continuous integration, GitHub facilitates efficient teamwork and streamlined workflows. Whether you are an individual developer or part of a large team, mastering Git and GitHub is crucial for efficient, organized, and collaborative software development.
